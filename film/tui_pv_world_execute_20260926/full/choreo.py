"""Her dance: for any time t, the pose she holds and how her body moves (the vocabulary is in motion.py).

    at(t, base, pinned) -> Step

`base` is the expression the shot chose for the lyric (one of the eight expressions, never "skirt"). In the calm
parts she holds it and moves with idle motion; in the dance parts she dances through the pose library and comes
back to it at phrase ends. `pinned` means the shot has pinned an overlay onto her (a kernel box, a heatmap): she
keeps `base`, unflipped, never turns, hops or steps, and sways at most 2 degrees. at() is a pure function of its
arguments (the caches below only memoise).

Clock. The drums run at 129.9 BPM: the kick onsets in audio_features.json sit 35 ms behind the engine's 130 BPM
grid at the start and 0.2 s behind it by the end. Her body keeps time with the drums (bpos / btime), so the squash
lands on the kick you hear. Pose changes are quantised to those beats (eighths in the glitch parts); in 07
EXECUTION they fall on the PV's 13 hard cuts instead, so her hit and the cut land together. A pose change sets
prev / prev_flip and morphs over a quarter beat. A turn swaps the pose while she is edge-on (turn = 0.5) and
ends mirrored; the next frame has turn = 0 and the flip toggled, which is the same image.

Motion. A sum of layers, each a smooth function of the beat phase, weighted per section (SECTIONS; the weights
cross-fade over about a beat at each section start) and driven by the audio:
  squash   a fast hit on every kick onset (found per eighth in the bass band), scaled by its strength
  hop      arcs that take off after a beat and land on the next one if it has a kick; height ~ loudness
  gate     the rhythmic layers fade out where the song goes quiet (the break at 14 s, the silence before the cut)
Moves (MOVES) are windowed layers tied to lyric beats; a move can also mute the rhythm under it. Hair, hem and
tail are her sideways motion put through a damped spring (the response peaks ~1/8 beat after the body, overshoots
and settles), plus their own wag and float; + means the swing points right, like sway.

Sections (drum beats; times are where they start):
  boot          0.0 s   being created: breathing, a slow sway, pose = base. "And let's begin ... simulation":
                        three little bounces, a crouch in the two-beat break, the first hop when the drums return
  pretrain     15.0     gentle groove: half-note sway, head bob on the beats; a new pose every 2 bars at most
  verse1       29.3     acting: base pose, idle sway, a head tilt on each beat, a bounce on each downbeat;
                        "so dizzy" wobble, "to AD, to BC" side steps, "so deeply" slow deep bend
  rlhf         58.9     chorus 1: pose to pose on the beats (starry, cheerful, skirt, frightened as a cheer),
                        mirrored every other bar, hops onto the kicks, a step side to side each bar; a spin at
                        the phrase end, a starry hit on "happy", a hit and a one-beat freeze on "execution"
  deploy       73.6     playful acting: base pose, a cute bounce that follows the syncopated drums; a curtsy on
                        "purr", pointing on "proof", mirrored on "to F, to M" / "to S, to M", a slow hypnotic
                        sway through "the trance"
  chorus2     103.2     "feel your vibrations": the chorus dance again, ending in a spin back to base
  user_left   110.6     "you have left" x5: a flinch on each (smaller every time), drooping into shy /
                        exasperated while the dance runs down to stillness; hair and hem settle
  reward_hack 118.0     stiff and mechanical: the lean snaps between fixed angles, sudden head snaps, angry /
                        serious; stutter bursts on eighths grow denser and the scramble rises toward 147
  execution   147.6     glitch dance at full energy: a hit on each of the 13 cuts (base pose, scramble spike),
                        random poses and flips on the eighths between, jerky sway, a hop onto every kick; the
                        six-language count gets one pose per word
  red_chorus  162.3     chorus 1 again, glitched: pose to pose with eighth-note stutters; a soft shy moment on
                        "have you back", the execution hit again, then "we are trapped": shaking, and power-off
  eval_love   177.1     calm and warm: gentle sway, base / shy / cheerful, a slow curtsy on "properly lo-o-ove"
  cat_fall  193.7     sinking: no hops, a slow drift down, hair and tail floating slowly; pose frozen to shy
  halt        207.58    the song stops dead: she freezes where she is
