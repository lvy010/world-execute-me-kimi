"""Group E (125.0-147.5 s, 06 REWARD_HACK: bridge and instrumental): the kimi window of batch_e.py.

Loaded by kimi_her.install() (install(D, v2), D = kimi_her). Everything is in memory and a strict no-op outside
125.0-147.5:

  COVER          (125.0, 147.5): her layer is the kimi window; s_reward's scenes only call kit.me_stub, and the
                 transition cuts (C60 collapse, C61 slide-in, C62 walk, C63 flood) draw her through kit.her_layer,
                 so the right side's choreography acts on the window unchanged
  LEAD           133.57 left (the retry loop stops on its last error), 133.80 back to both, so that the ILLEGAL
                 banner's flight into the router (from 134.02) has its full brightness. No other lead change: from
                 141.69 the window sits inside the right side's area (hoard) and would be dimmed with it
  RECT_FROM_CALL (141.2, 147.5): after C62 has walked the window to HOARD_ME, hoard (and C63's flood, which draws
                 hoard's call) keep it there instead of drawing it back at kit.LEFT. HOARD_ME is LEFT's size, so this
                 is a pure move; C62 itself draws at_left + dx and is unaffected
  pane title     as in DEPLOY, the shot's own suffix stays on the window's frame: hakimi web  mode=Creator,
                 hakimi web  !!, hakimi web  hoarding (the default pid title stays plain hakimi web)
