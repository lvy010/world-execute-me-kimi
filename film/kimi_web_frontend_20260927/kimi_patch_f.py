"""Group F's in-memory patches (147.5-177.0 s, 07 EXECUTION: the hits and the red chorus). Loaded by kimi_her.install().

Nothing here acts outside 147.5-177.0 s: the COVER / LEAD entries start at 147.5 (and G's start at 177.0), and every
wrapper hands back to the function it wraps outside that span.

  1. COVER (147.5, 177.0) and LEAD "both" for the whole group.
  2. P1, the hits. s_exec.STUB put kit.me_stub in sec_final; outside v2's own scene calls (STUB_ON false) the stub
     falls back to the original glyph pane, and sec_final is not among the globals kimi_her rewires (its shots were
     REPLACEd by scenes_exec, which calls SF.me_pane by attribute). Here sec_final.me_pane becomes: the stub while
     v2 draws a scene (it records her call as before), the kimi window (kimi_her.PANE[0]) inside a v1 hit frame, with
     the red frame the hit gives it. eyebar_red is dropped: the blindfold is on her avatar in the page (batch_f).
     Visible hits: #2, #6, #10 (layout 1) and #12 (layout 4).
  3. P2, the eye bar. s_exec.eye_overlay (shots 79, 81, 82, 83, and inside 84's walls_overlay) measured its place
     on the window's outline and put an EXECUTE bar over the header's status line. In the span it draws nothing:
     batch_f draws the bar on her avatar and the EXECUTE pill in the header from s_exec.eye_level(t) itself. 80
     keeps its kernel square, C80 its #0000 and C81 the receptive field that grows into the bar (it lands where the
     pill lights up). 84's walls: see F2 6.
  4. The kernel square of shot 80 stays on the chat; the horizontal scan line it drew across the window does not.

F2 (review 1, the author's notes on the full film):
  5. Hits #4 and #8 (layout 3 of scenes_exec.shot_exec_hit). The dancer's head with a bar below her eyes is replaced
     by a push-in on the kimi window's avatar (red.png's art in halfblock cells, f2_closeup.py); the EXECUTION bar
     drops in three frames and lands on her eyes on the sung word (#4: 150.75 s, the word at 150.736). On #8 the bar
     is on her eyes from the cut and a second, heavier one lands on top of it (154.417 s: the word is at 154.361,
     two frames after the cut, so it gets two frames in the air). The ps -ef table is the untouched original code
     (kit.patch_code swaps only the picture and the bar, and only inside the span).
  6. Cut 84's walls (walls_overlay: nested red outlines over the window) are dropped; the page closes its own walls
     on the chat (batch_f.walls_html). trapped_frame, which the collapse draws from, gets an empty layer.

F3 (review 2, the second review: EPERM's reason was still decoding when the 0.69 s shot ended):
  7. Hit #12 (layout 4, 158.005-158.697 s): "target is outside the sandbox." (typed at 50 chars/s from the cut) is
     replaced by one short line, REASON, drawn whole from the first frame, bold, in the system colour at full
     strength (the colour that drains when you leave: this is the one place it is still whole). EPERM, "operation
     not permitted", the box title and the cut times are the original code (kit.patch_code swaps that one line,
     in the same patch as F2 5, since patch_code reads the file's source).
  8. The count (shot 76, from 158.697 s) carries the line into its first beat: same text, same place on screen,
     on a dark plate over the count's empty slots. Full until "dos" (158.950), then gone by beat 344.5 (159.181).
     The count frame itself is s_exec.count_frame's own three steps; the line is drawn between finish and post.
