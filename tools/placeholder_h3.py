"""Stand-in dancer frames: write the dance takes the film draws her from, made from the Kimi reference art.

The right-hand side of the film (point clouds, sample grids, feature maps, heat maps, the glyph figure) is drawn from
frame caches of a dancing figure. The film's own takes are not part of this repository (see NOTICE.md). This tool
writes stand-ins with exactly the same take names, frame counts and file names, so the film renders unchanged:
the maid from film/third_party_references/kimi_reference_20261005/maid-left.webp, standing, swaying gently
from side to side once a bar and dipping slightly on every beat of the song.

    python tools/placeholder_h3.py              write every take that is missing
    python tools/placeholder_h3.py --force      also rewrite the takes this tool wrote before
    python tools/placeholder_h3.py --workers 4  processes for tracing (default: up to 8)

Takes that are already complete are left alone, so you can drop in your own takes (same format) and only the
missing ones are filled in. Takes this tool wrote are listed in <cache>/_standin.json; takes it did not write are
never overwritten, even with --force.

Caches and format (data/h3_takes.json lists every take, its frame count and its image indices):

    film/mmd_motion_eval_20260927/pv_cache/                            read by pv_full.py (entries named mmd_<take>)
    film/tui_pv_world_execute_20260926/continuity_full_v2/cache/h3_full_v1/   read by h3_full.py (PLAN names)

    <cache>/<take>.json            a list with one entry per frame of the take (24 fps; h3_full.py expects 124 or
                                   192): {"frame": i, "art": [...], "shade": [...], "part": [...]}, each a list of
                                   45 strings of 70 characters, one character per glyph cell: the glyph (art), the
                                   cell's brightness 0-7 (shade), the body part ('b', or ' ' for an empty cell)
    <cache>/rgba/<take>/NNN.png    frame NNN (000, 001, ...) as a 420x540 RGBA image on a transparent background:
                                   the figure standing on y 528, about 408 px tall, the shoes centred on x 228. The
                                   film crops it with the boxes full (0, 60, 420, 540), upper (0, 70, 420, 350),
                                   bust (40, 70, 390, 310) and face (80, 80, 335, 250)

The grids are traced from the images with the film's own tracer (continuity_full_v2/grok_rig.py: feet, matte and
trace on the figure composited over white, one glyph cell per 6x12 px), exactly as the original takes were.

How the stand-in moves: one bar (four beats) is rendered as a loop of LOOP frames and every frame of every take
reuses the loop frame for its bar phase. The phase comes from the song time the take plays at in the film (read
from pv_full.py's T0 and h3_full.py's PLAN), on the song's beat grid (beat k at FIRST_BEAT + k * BEAT seconds), so
the sway and the dips land on the music. The frames written are derived from the Kimi reference art and follow
the project asset terms in NOTICE.md.
